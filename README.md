# Operability App

Reliability, handling failure gracefully and recovering quickly are becoming increasingly important as the software development world adopts DevOps culture and practices. Outages and security failures are big news and many companies are investing heavily to avoid these challenges. Operable systems are easy to deploy and test, provide actionable information about their state and behave more predictably in adverse conditions.

Testers on development teams are often used to testing changes to the functionality of an application but less so testing how operable a system is. My recent experience has seen testers on teams charged with improving operability for systems through better logging, monitoring and system control measures (such as feature flags) to emit better information. This information on system stability and state is critical to testing and we can influence its creation profoundly.

This app will be iterated on and improved in order to facilitate the above.
